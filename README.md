### Description

The Bike Share Project is a comprehensive data analysis and management system designed to provide valuable
insights into urban bike-sharing programs. Through this project, we explore and visualize data from various cities, helping to optimize bike distribution, 
improve user experience, and promote eco-friendly transportation choices."

main.py: This is the main Python script that contains the code for analyzing and managing bike share data. It often includes functions for loading and processing data, as well as interactive user interfaces for querying and displaying information.

Data Files: These are the datasets containing bike share data for different cities. Common file formats include CSV (Comma-Separated Values) or Excel files. Each city's data may be stored in a separate file. Example data files might be named chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, and washington.csv.

README.md: This is a Markdown file that provides documentation and instructions for the project. It typically includes an overview of the project, how to run the code, and any additional details about the data and analysis.

.gitignore: This file lists the files or directories that should be ignored by Git when tracking changes. It's used to exclude sensitive or temporary files from version control.

Documentation Files: These files may include additional documentation, such as PDFs, Word documents, or Markdown files, that explain the project's objectives, methodologies, and findings in more detail.
